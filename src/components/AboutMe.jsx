        <p id="aboutme-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An alumni from Case Western Reserve University, I originally planned on becoming a pharmacist through the school's pre-medical program. However, I discovered my passion for front-end engineering and design 
        leading me to pursue further opportunities in the field. Driven to learn and develop my skills as a software engineer, I hope to use the insight and knowledge from my local peers for a foundation and grow through my own motivation reinforced through self learning. 
        I enjoy working with unfamiliar skills such as implementing new technologies and going as far as to learn new languages!"</p>
